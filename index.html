    <b>The Day I Was Teased by AI</b>

    <p>It is daunting to think that Artificial Intelligence (AI) may outsmart a human, and it feels even more so on the day you are outsmarted by one that you built yourself, by surprise. 
        <br><br>

        Reading up to this point, you probably figured out the AI mentioned is the AI running behind the TicTacToe. Yes I built the brain behind the game from scratch.
        <br>
        
        (Well, I didn’t write the whole script, it was an assignment in 
        <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/">CS50AI</a>
        . I simply built the intelligence on top of the runner script.)
        <br><br>
        
        I tested as a player against the AI. As the testing goes I randomly place my move, optimally or sub-optimally, on purpose. There it comes to this round where I was playing as X, 
        and dropped my third move on bottom left. I was expecting AI to score that round with her optimal move at bottom middle when it didn’t..
        <br><br>
        
        Instead the AI placed her third move on 
        <p style="color:green">MIDDLE LEFT</p>
        .
        <br><br>
        
        Oh well they said debugging is an inherent part of coding and so there I thought I’m gonna spend that afternoon resolving the bug. Hours have since passed and everything looks, perfectly normal! 
        Why is the AI not placing her move optimally and winning the game? I couldn't wrap my head around it, when suddenly it came to me that..
        <br><br>
        
        WAIT, WHAT, THE AI IS STILL GOING TO WIN THIS GAME..
        <br><br>
        
        There was a sigh of relief for a moment, when I realized that there wasn’t a bug in the code. It then was quickly followed by a mixed feeling of, mixed feeling.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>I WAS TEASED!</b>
        Instead of just winning the game the AI has chosen to take the longer route of humiliating her creator..
        <br><br>
        
        No, some of you are saying, the AI is not responsible for such intention. I gave the colours of emotions to her. That’s probably right, 
        and it is what human do since the beginning of civilisations, to project into our mind from our own perspective of what another human is thinking.
        <br><br>
        
        This thought does not relieve me however. My brain was lingering around all the sayings that suggest human is already outsmarted by AI in all aspects where logic could be programmed. 
        With machine learning the possibility even increases to another level. Just think of car that a human can drive, versus car that can self-drive, versus an AI that can tell a human how to build a self-driving car (er.. CHATGPT'ed)
        <br><br>
        
        In 2017, OpenAI defeated Dota 2 world champion. In one part of the game, in front of world's eyes, it was seen that the AI game character is teasing the human player by challenging him for an attack.
        When the human player soon chase after, he was found
        <p style="color:red">ambushed</p>
        by the other two AI characters, attacking from behind. Still can we claim the AI as uncanny and innocent?

        <br><br>

        Better think again...
